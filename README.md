A very prototyped/rudimentary tilemap creator using the LPC Projects tilemap atlasses for now.

Basically just run the application with yarn install and yarn start.

comes with collision and triggers, you can create tags for them so it makes it easier for collisions.

exports a json object to a file with the map, locations of the images and the sizes.

still needs an import for preexisting maps.

Feel free to make a pr if you want to add anything, this is just a fun project to help make maps for games in js, or i guess anything that parses the json files and images.
